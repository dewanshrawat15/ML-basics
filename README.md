# ML Basics

I'll be maintaining a list of notebooks in which I'm going to try solving different Machine Learning problems.

## Notebooks
- ```Boston Housing Price Prediction``` file houses a Linear Regression Model for predicting the house prices with different features
- ```Wine Classification``` file houses a Logistic Regression Model for classifying different classes of wine
- ```Breast Cancer Detection``` file houses a Support Vector Machine Model for classifying if the tumor is Malignant or Benign.
